- Feature: Calculate BMI
As a user
I want to calculate my BMI 
So that I will know if I have a healthy weight or not.

Scenario 1: The weight is invalid
Given that I want to calculate my BMI
When I input a weight equal to -70 and that I select the option BMI
Then the calculator shows an error message saying that the weight is invalid

Scenario 2: The height is invalid
Given that I want to calculate my BMI
When I input a height equal to -1.7 and that I select the option BMI
Then the calculator shows an error message saying that the weight is invalid

Scenario 3: Both values are correct
Given that I want to calculate my BMI
When I enter weight = 60 and I enter height = 1.68 and select the option BMI
Then the calculator gives me the value BMI = 21.258503401

- Feature: Determine category
As a user
I want to determine my category according to my BMI.
So that I will know if I am in a healthy category or not.

Scenario 1: Valid category
Given that I want to determine my category
When I input my weight <w> and I input my height <h>
Then the system computes the BMI and returns the category <c>
EXAMPLES
  w  |  h   | c           |
 70  | 1.95 | UNDERWEIGHT |
 65  | 1.68 | NORMAL      | 
 94.6| 1.87 | OVERWEIGHT  |
100.2| 1.77 | OBESE       |

The BMI value is computed by the system before determining the category. So any error produced when calculating the BMI value will be treated in that scenario. That is why we do not take into account error scenarios in this user story.

I want to determine if I have abdominal obesity according to my waist circumference and gender
So that I will know whether I must change my diet and exercise.
